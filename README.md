Colorizing black-and-white photos is one of the most fascinating uses of deep learning. Several years
ago, this task required a lot of human input and hard coding, but now the entire process can be done
end-to-end using the power of AI and deep learning. Generally, you need a large amount of data or
long training times to train the model from scratch for this task, but we have tried to work on a subset
of the big datasets to decrease the training time and try different model architectures, loss functions,
and training strategies. Eventually, we developed an efficient strategy to train such a model, using the
latest advances in deep learning, on a relatively small dataset and with extremely short training times
